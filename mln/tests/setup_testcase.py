	Both normal setup and class setup functions are registered by placing them in the SETUP class variable.
	Setup functions must be decorated with either @setup or @cls_setup, and can optionally be decorated with @requires to declare dependencies to other setup functions.
	The TestCase class recursively resolves setup functions, discarding duplicates, and calls them in the right order.
